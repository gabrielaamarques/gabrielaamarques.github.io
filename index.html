							Hi!
							<p>
							I'm Gabriela Marques, currently a postdoc at Fermilab (USA), and Associate Fellow at Kavli Institute of Cosmological Physics (KICP), U-Chicago.
							<p>
							My research focuses on utilizing data from the Cosmic Microwave Background and the Large-Scale Structure to constrain fundamental physics and comprehend the evolution of our Universe.
							I am enthusiastic about developing and implementing innovative techniques to optimally extract information from these observations.

							<p>
							I hold a Ph.D. and a master's degree in Astronomy from the Observatório Nacional in Brazil. I was raised in the beautiful state of Bahia, Brazil,
							before relocating to Brasilia, where I obtained my undergraduate degree in Physics from the University of Brasilia. Prior to joining the Fermilab Cosmic Physics Center, I held a postdoctoral position in the Department of Physics at Florida State University (USA).
							<p>
							Apart from Cosmology, I harbor a passion (not necessarily expertise) for various things, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira">capoeira</a>, outdoor activities, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p_hGQPSIu4">Brazilian percussion</a>, and painting.

								<br>
							 My current research is based on the interplay between theoretical, observations and cosmological simulations.
							 My particular niche in this broad theme is to analyze observations of the ancient light of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe to elucidate several fundamental topics in Physics.
							 In particular, I am intested in conducting cross-correlations between multiple probes, with the ultimate goal of constraining the growth of cosmic structures over cosmic time and providing insights about systematic effects.
								<br>I'm also interested in investigating non-Gaussian statistics as a complementary approach to comprehending the large-scale structure of our Universe.
